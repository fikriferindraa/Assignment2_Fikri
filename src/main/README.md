## Introduction
In this assignment 1, I can learn about Maven and how to do Web Scrapping. Maven is Automatic Build Tools that use in Java, for helping developer to comprehend the complete state of a development effort in the shortest period of time.
and Web Scraping is a method that makes it easy for you to retrieve data from sources such as websites, files, and others. by using the web scraping method, I can extract data from the provided table. data is separated for students and lecturers using threads,
with this we can process data easily. we can print starting from the number of students, a list of names of Malay/Chinese/Indian students, a list of supervisors, and all students from each supervisor.
that way web scraping will be much easier to extract data and maven can also help speed up the process in this assignment.
